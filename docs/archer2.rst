Running ESTEEM on the UK National Supercomputer ARCHER2
=======================================================

Most HPC clusters run a job queue, usually based on either SLURM or PBS. ESTEEM can write job scripts for either of these, but I use SLURM on most of the machines I have access to so this is likely to be better-tested.
