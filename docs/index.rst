ESTEEM: Explicit Solvent Toolkit for Electronic Excitations of Molecules
========================================================================

ESTEEM is an open source package for calculations of excited state and spectroscopic properties of molecules in solvent environments, developed by `Nicholas Hine <https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/nicholashine/>`_ at the University of Warwick.

It is built upon the python framework provided by the `Atomic Simulation Environment <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html>`_ and can call upon a number of different electronic structure and molecular dynamics codes, and machine-learning techniques.

The project is still under active development but is feature-complete and has some level of documentation (improving all the time). The codeâ€™s `git repository <https://bitbucket.org/ndmhine/esteem>`_ on bitbucket contains the latest development version and can be used to report any issues.

The Explicit Solvent methodology that has been adapted to a workflow in ESTEEM is based on the ideas described in the papers below.
If you find this project useful, I would appreciate if you cite these works:

ESTEEM is installable via pip: installation should be as simple as::

   $ pip3 install esteem
